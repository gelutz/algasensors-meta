## Libraries

### Client Application (`client/`)

- Always prefer to use components from the https://primeng.org/ library to build the UI.
- Always prefer to use tailwind CSS classes in a clean way.
- Do not make to the main object changes in files located inside folders named `models` or `model`.
- Follow a concise color theory based on the Catppuccin Mocha palette (https://catppuccin.com/palette/) that is already defined in the `client/src/utils/css/catppuccin-theme.ts` file.
